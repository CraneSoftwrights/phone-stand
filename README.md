A collapsible cell/mobile phone stand suitable for travel ... because I needed one!

The design is in layers so you can decorate the item however you wish.

The steps I followed in design is to:
- flip everything vertically so that the bottom of the stand sides are at the bottom of the diagram
  - work on the side panels
- flip everything vertically so that the bottom of the back rest is at the bottom of the diagram
  - work on the back rest

If your pattern is mirrored on the sides (as is the Crane pattern):
- delete the right design
- complete the left design
- copy the left design and mirror the copy
- align the mirror to the right edge of the outside box

Note that the back rest has no cuts of its own. Be sure to incorporate the back rest bars into the left and right.
